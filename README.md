## Smart India Hackathon 23

#### Ministry/Organization Name/Student Innovation:
Indian Space Research Organisation(ISRO)

#### Problem Statement Title:
SIH 1521 - Development of Explainable AI (XAI) based model for prediction of heavy /high impact rain events using satellite data

Development of an AI-based nowcasting model for predicting heavy precipitation events using INSAT-3D/3DR satellite data. Our system includes an explainable AI module (XAI) to enhance interpretability. The final output is delivered through a user-friendly web application, showcasing model accuracy and providing explanations for the generated predictions. This marks the achievement of our goals for SIH'23 Final.
